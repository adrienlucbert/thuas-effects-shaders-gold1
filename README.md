# Complex effect

This is the first gold achievements for the Effects & Shaders class in THUAS'
Game Development & Simulation minor.

## Instructions

Create a complex effect with at least three different shaders in it (VS, PS &
GS/Tess).

### Requirements

- The effect should be written with the HLSL language only, and thus be
game-engine-agnostic. It must be able to run in Unity for instance, but also
other softwares.
- The effect must include at least a vertex shader, a fragment shader and a
third shader which can be either a geometry or a hull shader.
- The vertex shader must at least use some kind of algorithm to transform the
vertices. It must have some complexity.
- The fragment shader must at least use two textures and combine them.

### Result

*Work in progress*
